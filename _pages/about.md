Hi! I am Wang Piao Hong. I am now a Mphil student in [The HongKong University Of Science And Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/zh-hans). My present research interest is solving medical problems with AI. Before coming to HKUST, I studied in [South China University Of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) from 2017 to 2021 and worked as a software engineer in [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.com/) from 2021. Besides, I used to be a MEng student in [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.edu/) for short term study.

# Project
[2021.10] I am working on a project about predicting the life-expectancy of lung cancer patients based on deep learning. I propose a new multi-task network and gain 80% accuracy. The code will be published in Github before December.
