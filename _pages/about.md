Hi! I am Wang Piao Hong.
I am now a Mphil student in [The HongKong University Of Science And Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/zh-hans). My present research interest is solving medical problems with AI techniques.
Before joining HKUST, I studied in [South China University Of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) from 2017 to 2021 and worked as a software engineer in [HSBC](https://www.hsbc.com/) from 2021.
Besides, I used to be a MEng student in [IIT](https://www.iit.edu/) for short term study.
